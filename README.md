# Agentic-GenAi Engineer


## Overview
This repository documents my 4-month journey to become a Generative AI and Agentic AI engineer, culminating in a production-ready multi-agent customer support system. It includes Python scripts, 18 mini-projects, and ~35 assignments covering:
- **Core Skills**: Python, NLP, LangChain, LangGraph, multi-modal LLMs.
- **Agentic AI**: Pydantic, LangFlow, n8n for building autonomous agents.
- **MLOps**: Model versioning (MLflow), drift detection, Airflow orchestration.
- **AIOps**: Anomaly detection, predictive maintenance with LangSmith.
- **Main Project**: A multi-agent customer support system using LangGraph and AWS.

## Goals
- Master Generative AI and Agentic AI for production-grade systems.
- Build a portfolio with mini-projects (e.g., text preprocessor, RAG pipeline).
- Prepare for AI engineering roles by November 2025 (or later).

## Structure
- `/scripts`: Python scripts for daily tasks (e.g., `numpy_basics.py`).
- `/mini-projects`: 18 mini-projects (e.g., text preprocessor, Week 1).
- `/assignments`: ~35 assignments (e.g., word frequency analysis).
- `/main-project`: Multi-agent customer support system (built incrementally).

## Setup
- **Environment**: Python 3.9+ (Anaconda, `genai` environment).
- **Tools**: VS Code, GitHub for version control.
- **Dependencies**: NumPy, pandas, LangChain (added as needed).

## Progress
- **Week 1 (July 2â€“8, 2025)**: Python setup, NumPy, pandas, API basics.
- **Started**: July 2, 2025.
